          Chopra has also repeatedly shown she's unafraid of taking risks. For
          her Met Gala debut in 2017, Chopra wore custom-made Ralph Lauren
          trench coat with a dramatic collar and sweeping train. She followed it
          up in 2018 with an intricate beaded headdress. Then, last year, she
          matched a feathery silver-and-pastel gown by Dior, with frizzled hair,
          silver-frosted brows and raspberry eyeshadow.

            <h4>Russia adds record 10,000 coronavirus...</h4>
            <p>
              Russia reported 10,633 new coronavirus cases on Sunday, its fourth
              record single-day increase in a row, in what is becoming a major
              headache for President Vladimir Putin. The country's total number
              of cases is now 134,687, the seventh-highest number in the world,
              in a dramatic turnaround from the situation back in March. A total
              of 1,280 deaths has now been recorded, the country's coronavirus
              response headquarters said in a statement, adding that around 50%
              of the cases were asymptomatic. Moscow, the country's worst-hit
              city, accounts for more than a half of total cases.

            <h4>Closing a wound</h4>
            <p>
              High above the Polcevera valley, the final section of a majestic
              new bridge was hoisted into place this week, signaling the
              imminent completion of a remarkable engineering project against
              seemingly impossible odds. The bridge is a critical traffic artery
              for northern Italy. It connects two sides of the city of Genoa and
              serves its busy mercantile port, while being part of the E80
              European highway that links Italy to France. It's also on a main
              route used by holidaymakers heading to the Ligurian Riviera from
              cities like Turin and Milan. More importantly, it was built on the
              scene of tragedy, replacing an earlier structure, the Morandi
              bridge, which collapsed on August 14, 2018, killing 43 people.

            <h4>When vaccines don't work</h4>
            <p>
              In 1984, the US Secretary of Health and Human Services Margaret
              Heckler announced at a press conference in Washington, DC, that
              scientists had successfully identified the virus that later became
              known as HIV -- and predicted that a preventative vaccine would be
              ready for testing in two years. Nearly four decades and 32 million
              deaths later, the world is still waiting for an HIV vaccine.
              Instead of a breakthrough, Heckler's claim was followed by the
              loss of much of a generation of gay men and the painful shunning
              of their community in Western countries. For many years, a
              positive diagnosis was not only a death sentence; it ensured a
              person would spend their final months abandoned by their
              communities, while doctors debated in medical journals whether HIV
              patients were even worth saving.

              The human needs driving the rise in gardening, and how to start
              one
            </h4>
            <p>
              Local plant nurseries are seeing spikes in seed sales. People are
              starting vegetable gardens big and small, including a plethora of
              backyard plots and windowsill herbs. Some plant lovers are engaged
              in community gardens where they work in timed shifts, maintaining
              proper distance while wearing masks and cleansing tools for the
              next use. As people sheltering in place take up hobbies and start
              projects to fill the time during the coronavirus pandemic,
              gardening is blooming.
